 Quantitative Modeling: Modeled market volatility using a simulated GARCH model in R to 
produce statistical risk forecasts, a key input for the strategy's risk management component.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integrated a simulated BERT model for sentiment analysis in 
Python, transforming unstructured financial news into a quantifiable data stream to gauge market 
mood
BI Dashboarding & Visualization: Developed an interactive dashboard using JavaScript 
(ApexCharts) to replicate a Tableau/Power BI environment, effectively communicating the results 
of multiple complex models to a non-technical audience.
Performance Backtesting & Evaluation: Quantified the historical performance of the AI strategy 
by creating a backtesting module that calculated and visualized essential financial metrics, 
including Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return) and Max Drawdown (peak-to-trough decline).
Data Synthesis: Engineered a data pipeline concept to ingest, process, and synthesize disparate data 
sources (structured time-series and unstructured text) into a unified dataset for analysis and model 
input.
